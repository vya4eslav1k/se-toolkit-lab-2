## Find a partner

1. Find a classmate to be your partner for this lab.
2. Sit together.

## Set up a fork

1. Create a `GitHub` account.
2. Go to the [original repo](https://github.com/inno-se-toolkit/lab-01-market-product-and-git) (repository).
3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) the original repo.
4. Go to your fork.
5. The URL should be like `https://github.com/<your-username>/lab-01-market-product-and-git`.
6. If you see a lock sign near your fork name, [make your fork public](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#changing-a-repositorys-visibility).

> [!NOTE]
> Continue working in your fork.

## Enable issues

1. Go to `Settings` -> `General` -> `Features`.
2. Check the box near `Issues`.

## Add a classmate as a collaborator

1. Go to `Settings` -> `Collaborators` -> `Add people`.
2. Add your partner as a collaborator.
3. Your partner should add you as a collaborator in their repo.
4. Make sure your collaborator has accepted the invitation sent to their email.
5. It's OK if your collaborator can't change `Settings` in your repo.

## Protect your `main` branch

Branch protection prevents accidental pushes directly to `main`.
This enforces the PR workflow and ensures all changes are reviewed.

1. Go to your fork on `GitHub`.
2. Go to `Settings`.
3. Go to `Code and automation`.
4. Go to `Rules`.
5. Go to `Rulesets`.
6. Go to `New ruleset`.
7. Go to `Add branch ruleset`.
8. Set:

   1. `Ruleset Name`: `push`
   2. `Enforcement status`: `Active`
   3. `Target branches` -> `Add target` -> `Include default branch`
   4. Rules:
      - [x] `Restrict deletions`
      - [x] `Require a pull request before merging`:
         - `Required approvals`: `1`
         - `Require conversation resolution before merging`
         - `Allowed merge methods`: `Merge`.
      - [x] Block force pushes

## Install `Git`

[Install `Git`](https://git-scm.com/install/).

## Install `VS Code`

1. Install [`VS Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

   We chose this editor because it has built-in AI features and many useful [extensions](./appendix/vs-code.md#extensions).

2. (Optional) [Learn more](../lab/appendix/vs-code.md) about `VS Code`.

## Open the `Terminal`

1. Open `VS Code`.
1. [Open the Terminal](./appendix/vs-code.md#open-the-terminal).

## Configure `Git`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replace `<your-name>` with a name and `<your-email>` with an email that you want to see in the commits.

1. (Optional) See [docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-username) for an explanation of what these commands do.
2. [Run using the `Terminal`](./appendix/vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-terminal):

    ```console
    git config --global user.name '<your-name>'
    ```

    Example: `git config --global user.name 'John Doe'`

3. [Run using the `Terminal`](./appendix/vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-terminal):

     ```console
     git config --global user.email '<your-email>'
     ```

     Example: `git config --global user.name 'johndoe@gmail.com'`

## Open `VS Code` in the `software-engineering-toolkit` directory

1. On your computer, create somewhere a directory `software-engineering-toolkit` (e.g., on your `Desktop`).
2. Open `VS Code`.
3. [Run using the `Command Palette`](./appendix/vs-code.md#command-palette): `File: Open Folder...`.
4. Find the `software-engineering-toolkit` directory that you created.
5. Open this directory.
6. `VS Code` should now open in that directory.
7. [Open `Folders`](./appendix/vs-code.md#open-folders).
8. Look at `FOLDERS`.
9. You should see `SOFTWARE-ENGINEERING-TOOLKIT` there.

## Copy your fork URL

1. Go to your fork on `Gitub`.
1. Copy its [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL).
1. It should look like `https://github.com/<your-username>/lab-01-market-product-and-git`.

## Clone the fork on your computer

Clone the fork using one of these approaches:

- [Clone the fork using the `Terminal`](#clone-the-fork-using-the-terminal)

    git clone <fork-url>
    ```

    Note: replace `<fork-url>` with the copied fork URL.
1. [Run using the `Terminal`](./appendix/vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-terminal):

   ```console
   ls
   ```

1. You should see `lab-01-market-product-and-git` - the directory with the cloned repo.

## Optional enhancements

These enhancements can make your life easier:

- [Set up a coding agent](#set-up-a-coding-agent)
- [Set up the shell prompt](#set-up-the-shell-prompt)
- [Check `GitLens`](#check-gitlens)

### Set up a coding agent

A coding agent can help you write code, explain concepts, and debug issues.

See [Coding agents](./appendix/coding-agents.md).

### Set up the shell prompt

`Starship` shows your current `Git` branch, status, and other useful info directly in your [shell prompt](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_Unix/Explanations/Shell_Prompt) in almost any terminal, including the [`Terminal`](./appendix/vs-code.md#terminal).

Complete these steps:

1. Install [`Starship`](https://github.com/starship/starship#-installation).
2. [Open the `Terminal`](./appendix/vs-code.md#open-the-terminal).
3. You should see something like `lab-01-market-product-and-git on main`.

### Check `GitLens` in `VS Code`

<!-- TODO create appendix gitlens -->

4. See `COMMITS <branch-name>`.
5. See commits below it.
6. Click a commit to open a list of files changed in that commit.
7. Click a file changed in that commit to see changes in that file.

#### Inspect remotes

1. [Open the `Source Control`](../lab/appendix/vs-code.md#open-the-source-control).
2. Click `GITLENS` to uncollapse the view.
3. Hover over the `GITLENS` view name.

   1. Hover over `origin`:
   2. Look at URLs.

#### (Optional) Learn more about `GitLens`

See [`GitLens` features](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/gitlens-features/).

### Create a label for tasks

[Labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) help you filter and organize issues.

With a `task` label, you can see in one view all issues created for lab tasks.

> [!TIP]
> If you create the `task` label before creating issues, your issues will have this label automatically as configured in the [issue form](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml).

Complete these steps:

1. [Create the `task` label](#create-the-task-label)
1. [Add the label to issues](#add-the-label-to-issues)
1. [See all issues with the label](#see-all-issues-with-the-label)

#### Create the `task` label

#### See all issues with the label

1. Go to your fork.
2. Go to `Issues`.
3. If you don't see any `Open` issues, click `Closed`.
4. Filter issues by the label:
   1. Click `Labels`.
   2. In the `Filter labels` input area, write `task`.
   3. Click the suggested label.
5. You should see all issues that have the `task` label.
